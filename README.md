# PythonDataScienceFullThrottle2e
New repository for my  **Python Data Science Full Throttle: Introductory Artificial Intelligence (AI), Big Data and Cloud Case Studies** live training on [O'Reilly Online Learning](https://learning.oreilly.com/live-events/python-data-science-full-throttle-with-paul-deitel-introductory-artificial-intelligence-ai-big-data-and-cloud-case-studies/0636920289197/).

<!--# Running the Code Examples
The easiest way to run most of the code examples is to use the Dockerfile to create a Docker container. 

From the folder containing the Dockerfile, run the command: 
> `docker build -t deitelpydsft .`
 
From the root folder of this course's examples, run the `deitelpydsft` Docker container with the following command:
> docker run --rm -p 8888:8888 -p 4040:4040 -it --user root \
>    -v .:/home/jovyan/work deitelpydsft start.sh jupyter lab

Your command-line window will show you the URL to use to access the notebooks in your web browser.

# Custom Conda Environment
Rather than using Docker, you can set up a custom Anaconda environment on your local computer. These are the commands I used. They create a custom environment named `pydsft` — you can choose any name you like:

* Create the custom environment

> conda create --name pydsft

* Activate the environment you just created

> conda activate pydsft

* The following two commands install most of what you need for the content from ch11, ch12, ch13, ch14, ch15 and a good chunk of ch16—if you’re working from our books or videos, you might need to subsequently install a few other packages. **NOTE: You might want to install one package at a time from the following command as it can take a significant amount of time to resolve all the interdependencies if you do it all at once.**
 
> conda install nodejs jupyterlab ipympl wordcloud spacy tweepy geopy folium scikit-learn tensorflow matplotlib seaborn pymongo dnspython imageio pyaudio pydub 

> pip install -U dweepy pubnub ibm-watson tweet-preprocessor textblob deep_translator deepL 
 
The `pip` command is needed because a few packages are not available through the `conda` repository. 

If any package install fails with `conda` on Windows, use `pip` to install it. 

I'll keep this repository up-to-date with any changes I make for future presentations.

# Setup for Executing the Examples
The notebooks contain links to my videos and book on O'Reilly Online Learning where I discuss setup issues.
